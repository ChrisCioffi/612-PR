# Git Pull Request Assignment

This is an assignment for my students in STAT 612. If you are not one of them, please ignore this repository.

For my students, the goal is to fix the error.qmd file such that it results in plots matching the two pngs.
In order to achieve that, you have to take the following steps:

## Step 1: Forking the Repository

Use githubs tool's to fork the repository to one that will be your own. Please make this private.

## Step 2: Fix the Errors

Working out of the repository you have created, fix the errors in the qmd file that I gave you so that you can create two images that match up with the two I have included in the github

## Step 3: Create a Pull request

Create a pull request to my repository

# The Images
